Description:
This plugin will start adb with the logcat option and pipe the output to
/tmp/adb-logcat-output.adb by default. That file then is loaded into a preview 
window. The preview window will reload the contents of
/tmp/adb-logcat-output.adb and scroll to the last line of the buffer
automatically. To start and turn off this process press <F2> in normal mode.

	1. Vim 7.0+
